    <h2>My favorite vacation spot is Key Largo</h2>
    <p>If i got a chance to spend rest of my life at one place, one of that place will be Key Largo in Florida. 
    <strong>In my view Key Largo</strong> is the place for people looking to leave the sand and enjoy everything the ocean has to offer.
    With offerings like the Florida </strong>Keys National Marine Sanctuary</strong> and </strong>John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park</strong>,
    visitors are encouraged to throw on a mask and have an adventure below the surface. </p>
